# CS 7641 Assignment 1: Supervised Learning

This project seeks to understand the computatitonal and predictive qualities of five classification algorithms:
- Decision trees
- Boosting
- Support vector machines (2 kernels: poly and rbf)
- Neural networks
- K nearest neighbors

Each algorithm will be run for two binary classification datasets so that we can compare and contrast them for two different problems:
- Wind speed: https://www.openml.org/d/503 and https://www.openml.org/d/847
- Customer retaintion: https://www.openml.org/d/42178

## Getting Started & Prerequisites
`git clone https://github.com/prash200/omscs7641.git
cd assignment1
pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Running the Classifiers
- Best Way: Work with the iPython notebook (main.ipnyb) using Jupyter or a similar environment. This allows you to "Run All" or you can run only the classifiers that you are interested in.
- Second Best Way: Run the python script (main.py).
