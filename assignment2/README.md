# CS 7641 Assignment 2: Randomized Optimization

This project seeks to understand the computatitonal and optimization characteristics of four randomized optimization algorithms:
- Randomized Hill Climbing (RHC)
- Simulated Annealing (SA)
- Genetic Algorithm (GA)
- Mutual-Information-Maximizing Input Clustering (MIMIC)

These algorithms will be applied to 3 discrete optimization problem domains:
- Continuous Peaks Problem (CPP)
- K-Colorable Problem (KCP)
- Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)

Finally, these algorithms (except MIMIC) are also applied to 1 continuous optimization problem domain:
- Neural Network Weights Optimization Problem (NNWOP)
to solve the wind speed classification problem mentioned here:
- Wind speed dataset: https://www.openml.org/d/847

## Getting Started & Prerequisites
`git clone https://github.com/prash200/omscs7641.git`

`cd assignment2`

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Running the Classifiers
- Best Way: Work with the iPython notebook (main.ipnyb) using Jupyter or a similar environment. This allows you to "Run All" or you can run only the classifiers that you are interested in.
- Second Best Way: Run the python script (main.py).
